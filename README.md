- **Internet Identity**: Secure authentication without passwords
- **Candid**: Interface definition language for canisters
- **ic-cdk**: Canister development kit for Rust

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- [DFX SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org/) - Internet Computer development toolkit
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) - Systems programming language

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/icp-scholar.git
cd icp-scholar
```

2. **Start the Internet Computer local replica**
```bash
dfx start --background
```

3. **Deploy the canisters**
```bash
dfx deploy
```

4. **Generate canister bindings**
```bash
dfx generate
```

5. **Install frontend dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

6. **Start the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Authentication

ICP Scholar uses **Internet Identity** for secure, passwordless authentication:

1. Click "Login" on the homepage
2. Choose "Create New" or "Already have an anchor?" on the Internet Identity page
3. Follow the prompts to create or access your Internet Identity
4. Grant permission to ICP Scholar
5. You'll be redirected to your dashboard

## How It Works

### Course System
1. **Educators** create courses with multiple text-based sections
2. **Students** browse published courses and enroll
3. Students read through course content and mark sections as complete
4. Upon completing all sections, students can download a verified certificate
5. **Token rewards** are automatically distributed upon course completion

### Token Economy
- Tokens are minted by educators or the admin canister
- Students earn tokens by completing courses
- Tokens can be used to tip helpful peers in the community
- All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency

### Peer Learning
- Students can post questions, answers, study notes, and tips
- Community members can tip valuable contributions with tokens
- This creates an incentivized learning environment where knowledge sharing is rewarded
